							<h1>Thursday</h1>
							
							<p>On Thursday, I was taken to the Server room, where I was shown how to change a tape in the server. I was also shown how to build and set up a computer that had been memory wiped. It took me a while but I eventually finsihed it off.  I also started to learn how to code in Javascript. The process for the pc build is very complicated and long winded. I started off by downloading a lot of software off of a USB stick that had everything that the company wanted to have on their computers. Secondly, I installed a load of apps and networks that was also needed for the laptop for companies use. Lastly, I made sure that all of the configurations were in order so that nothing went wrong with the computer.</p>
